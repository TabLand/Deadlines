Deadlines
=========

A script to publicly display all my coursework deadlines to date. The script also tells me how many years, months, days, hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds I can procrastinate for!  
  
**To do:**  
Upload sources  
Fix font size, and formatting if possible  
Find a way to sort the dates by time left
